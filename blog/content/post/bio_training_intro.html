<h1>March 30, 2020</h1>
<p>Hello, and welcome to a summary the first training session for bio-group technical
development! This is an Rmarkdown document that will walk you through what we
did in the first session on March 30, 2020.</p>
<p>With the myriad statistics of the novel coronavirus pervading most media outlets,
we opted to examine the data ourselves to obtain a clearer understanding of the
spread of the disease. We opted to use the dataset maintained bythe Johns Hopkins
University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE), for two main
reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>They maintain a most excellent data dashboard located here:
(<a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6" class="uri">https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6</a>)
Of particular interest to us is the spatial location data, meaning that we too
can generate our own maps from these data. Thanks to Kelsey for the original
share!</p></li>
<li><p>The entire dataset is conveniently located on <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19"><em>GitHub</em></a>, updated daily, and is entirely
contained within comma-separated-values files (.csv files). Many modern
programming languages,including R and Python, have libraries or packages that
interface well with .csv files, making it a breeze to ingest, manipulate, and
analyze the data within!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the next post, <a href="https://qsi-cvo-bioanalytics.netlify.com/2020/03/30/data-download-and-sanitation-and-our-first-plot/"><em>Data Download and Sanitation</em></a>,
we will walk through the initial setup of this project, which includes dowloading, cleaning, and organizing the data, and we will finish bygenerating a plot of the daily mortality rate in the U.S. as well as the total
to-date U.S. recovery count. This document is in a format known as <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/"><em>R Markdown</em></a>,
which allows us to easily run each code chunk one at a time. The code is
organized so that we may easily adapt and expand upon it to answer other questions
of interest, which so far have includued adding country population counts to the
dataset and generating animated heatmaps of infections/deaths/recoveries over time.<br />
Together, hopefully we will create some meaning from this unique situation and
grow our knowledge and skillsets to better ourselves and our communities!</p>
<p>This blog will serve as a summary of our development sessions, as well as a resource
hub for futher information on the topics we cover. Have fun, and
