<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, and welcome to the website for the Bio-Group Development Series! Here we
will publish blog posts related to the various Monday-evening trainings as well
as resources for you to further delve into to the topics covered. In this first
set of trainings, we are looking at some data on the spread of COVID-19 virus, as
explained below.</p>
</div>
<div id="covid-19-dataset" class="section level1">
<h1>COVID-19 Dataset</h1>
<p>With the myriad statistics of the novel coronavirus pervading most media outlets,
we opted to examine the data ourselves to obtain a clearer understanding of the
spread of the disease. We opted to use the dataset maintained bythe Johns Hopkins
University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE), for two main
reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>They maintain <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6"><em>a most excellent data dashboard</em></a>
with a visually appealing spatial map of reported cases. Of particular interest
to us is the spatial location data, meaning that we too can generate our own maps
from these data. Thanks to Kelsey for the original share!</p></li>
<li><p>The entire dataset is conveniently located on <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19"><em>GitHub</em></a>,
updated daily, and is entirely contained within comma-separated-values files
(.csv files). Many modern programming languages,including R and Python, have
libraries or packages that interface well with .csv files, making it a breeze to
ingest, manipulate, and analyze the data within!</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In the next post, <a href="https://bioanalytics-cvo-quantumspatial.netlify.com/2020/03/30/data-download-and-sanitation-and-our-first-plot"><em>Data Download and Sanitation</em></a>,
we will walk through the initial setup of this project, which includes dowloading,
cleaning, and organizing the data, and we will finish by generating plots of the
daily confirmed, death, and recovery counts any country contained in the dataset.</p>
<p>This document is in a format known as <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/"><em>R Markdown</em></a>,
which allows us to easily run each code chunk one at a time. The code is
organized so that we may easily adapt and expand upon it to answer other questions
of interest, which so far have includued adding country population counts to the
dataset and generating animated heatmaps of infections/deaths/recoveries over time.</p>
<p>Together, hopefully we will create some meaning from this unique situation and
grow our knowledge and skillsets to better ourselves and our communities!</p>
<p>As mentioned before, this blog will serve as a summary of our development sessions,
as well as a resource hub for futher information on the topics we cover. It will
be updated contiunally, so be sure to check back in from time to time for updates.
So, have fun, and
<a href="https://bioanalytics-cvo-quantumspatial.netlify.com/2020/03/30/data-download-and-sanitation-and-our-first-plot"><em>letâ€™s get to it!</em></a></p>
