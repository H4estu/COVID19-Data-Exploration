<h2>A Brief introduction to the R Programming Language</h2>
<p><strong>R</strong> is an open-source language designed for, among other things, statistical computing. It is
easy to download on your computer and immediately begin running code. Many of the projects
at work (e.g. CADWR, CalWater) rely heavily on tools written in R to ingest, process, and QC
data in an automated fashion.</p>
<p>R has a number of handy extensions written for it, greatly extending the feature set of the
language. Some packages, such as RMarkdown, allow for automated report generation, converting For example, these blogs and this site are written entirely in R!</p>

<p><strong>RStudio</strong> is an integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed to enhance
software development in R. Perhaps most useful is the console window, which runs a
read-eval-print loop (REPL) that immediately reads any code you give to it, evaluates it, and
returns the results to you. This is immensely helpful for understanding line-by-line what
a script is doing. Additionally, it can be quite helpful when debugging your code!</p>
